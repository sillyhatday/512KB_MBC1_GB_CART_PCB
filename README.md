# 512KB_MBC1_GB_CART_PCB

A simple Gameboy cartridge. It uses an original MBC1 cartridge chip. The EPROM is designed to stick out the top of the cartridge. Not a tidy setup, but I think has a certain cyberpunk look.

The PCB files are ready to be uploaded to whichever manufacturer you wish. This design has been tested and does indeed work properly.
